# HTTPS, SSL, and SSL Termination

This document provides an overview of HTTPS, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), and SSL termination.

## HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol, designed to ensure secure communication between a user's web browser and a website's server. It employs SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to achieve data security.

### Main Roles of HTTPS SSL

1. **Encryption:** HTTPS SSL encrypts the data transmitted between a user's browser and a website's server. This encryption prevents unauthorized individuals from intercepting and understanding the data during transmission.

2. **Authentication:** HTTPS SSL verifies the authenticity of a website's server through SSL/TLS certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). This assures users that they are connecting to the intended website and not a malicious impostor.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic

The primary purpose of encrypting traffic using HTTPS SSL is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. This is particularly crucial when users submit personal or financial data on a website. Encryption ensures the confidentiality and security of this data as it traverses the internet.

## SSL Termination

SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted data at a specific point within a network, often at a load balancer or reverse proxy server. This decryption allows for tasks such as load balancing, content caching, or deep packet inspection to be performed on the traffic. After processing, the data can be re-encrypted before reaching the final destination.

SSL termination is valuable for optimizing network traffic and offloading encryption-related tasks from backend servers.
